        <i>The school i study in is Bahria College Naval Anchorage</i>
        <i>This school provudes Matric and Cambridge Education</i><br>
        <i>There are 4 blocks for different categories:</i>
           <p><i>The first and most junior category is Montessory Wing.In this group there are 3 classes that are further divided into 8 sections. Each class has:</i><br>
            <i> Low, open shelves with self-correcting materials (practical life, sensorial, language, math)
Child-sized tables/chairs arranged in small work areas and floor work mats
Natural light, neutral colors, minimal wall clutter, labeled baskets/trays
Practical-life corner (pouring, spooning, dressing frames), reading nook, and peace/calm area
Display at child eye-level, lots of hands-on materials vs. posters</i></p>
  <p>Then the Primary wing.
    This wing has classes from 1-5.These classes are also divided into another 8 sections. There are seperate teavhers for each subject.In primary wing
    subjects like Social studies(S.St), Science are added.Uptil grade 5, its Co-Ed.Now in this wing children have access to coputer labs.The classrooms of this 
    wing are a bit different as they consist of:
    <dl>Teaching Style & Activities
There’s also an emphasis on speaking and listening: for example, children are encouraged to retell stories, record themselves, and practice speaking with expression. 
Writing skills are practiced through neat handwriting, diary entries, and more. 
For subjects like Mathematics and Creative Work, the Class I worksheet requires “colorful booklets,” charts, poster making, and models. 
This indicates that classes are interactive, hands-on, and not just rote learning.</dl>
<dl>Curriculum & Subject Focus
In primary classes, they cover core subjects like English, Mathematics, Urdu, and non-core like Islamiyat, General Science, Social Studies, Arts & Craft, and Computer. (This is based on Bahria College Karachi’s primary curriculum, but likely similar for BCA since it’s under the same system. ) 
For a class like Class 3, the syllabus includes English literature & grammar, math (tables, number operations, geometry), General Knowledge, computer topics, and art/craft. 
So classes probably balance academics + creative work.</dl>
Student Experience
Since the primary wing is co-educational, boys and girls are likely mixed in these classes. 
  </p>
  <p> The school then has 3 other wing Cambridge wing(O/A Levels), the boys and girls wing (Matric Stream)</p>
  <p>The school has then different laboratories that the students can get access to after grade 5.<br>
